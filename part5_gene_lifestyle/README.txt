## Key Features:
- **Gender-specific PGS for Prostate Cancer and Breast Cancer**:
  - For **prostate cancer** and **breast cancer**, gender-specific PGS files are used, with separate calculations for males and females.
  - **Sex is not included as a covariate** in the model for these specific cancers, as the PGS already accounts for the gender difference.
